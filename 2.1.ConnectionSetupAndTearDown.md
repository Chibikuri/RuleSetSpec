# Connection Setup and Teardown

## Connection Setup
In the connection setup phase, the initiator (an end node quantum computer that sends starts a process) sends a request to a responder (an end node quantum computer that provides a quantum application service) and that responder creates a set of RuleSet and distributes them to the intermediate quantum repeaters and routers.
