# Connection Teardown

## Connection Teardown

## Protocol Sequence (Edge case?)
An example sequence of the entire protocol

    autonumber
    participant i1 as Initiator 1
    participant i2 as Initiator 2 
    box Orange MIM Link
    participant ra as Repeater A
    participant bsa as BSA
    participant rb as Repeater B
    end 
    participant r2 as Responder 2
    participant r1 as Responder 1

    %% Connection between initiator and responder
    i1 --> r1: Connection 1 (cid = 1)
    i2 --> r2: Connection 2 (cid = 2)
    
    %% Send terminate notification to Repeater B
    r1 ->> rb: Terminate Connection 1

    %% Now all the operations are done asynchronously
    bsa -->> ra: Photon ID (237)
    bsa -->> rb: Photon ID (237)
    
    Note over ra: Assign 237 to Connection 1
    Note over rb: Hold 237
    
    r1 ->> ra: Terminate Connection 1
    rb ->> ra: Switch to Sync Mode
    ra ->> rb: Sync Ack (I assigned 237 to cid=1)
    Note over rb: Assign 237 to Connection 1
    rb ->> ra: Ack
```

:warning: (Under construction)
- How and when do we notify it to the application?
- What information to be attached?
