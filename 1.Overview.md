# RuleSet

## Introduction
*RuleSet* is a set of instructions for [quantum repeaters](https://qt.eu/discover-quantum/underlying-principles/quantum-repeaters/) which allows us to communicate quantum information over the long distance. RuleSet works as a management scheme for those quantum repeaters as it tells what to do next for quantum repeaters.
